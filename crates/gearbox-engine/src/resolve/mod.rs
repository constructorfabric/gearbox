//! Turning a catalogue plus an intent into a resolved product.

//! Pure: no I/O, no clock, no environment. Deterministic by construction --
//! every map is a `BTreeMap`, every set a `BTreeSet`, and every output vector is
//! sorted by its identity tuple before it leaves. That is not tidiness. The lock
//! is hashed, and a hash that changes when nothing did is a hash nobody trusts.
//!
//! Errors do **not** abort. A product that fails one check still resolves as far
//! as it can, because a partial graph with three diagnostics is more useful than
//! one diagnostic and nothing to look at. Refusing to *write* the lock is a
//! separate decision, made by the caller.
