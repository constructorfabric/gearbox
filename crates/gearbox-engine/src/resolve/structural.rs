//! Step 5: constraints the runtime imposes on a topology.
//!
//! Every check here mirrors something the platform actually does, and the value
//! of the step is that it says so *before* a binary is built rather than when one
//! fails to start. The two that matter most are the ones the runtime enforces
//! silently: a second REST host in a process, which the registry rejects, and a
//! REST host inside a worker, which starts happily and then never receives
//! traffic because a worker serves through its own out-of-process router.
//!
//! Directory discovery has two prerequisites that are easy to miss because
//! neither is named in the description: the directory server itself, and the gRPC
//! hub the spawn phase blocks on while waiting for its endpoint. Missing either
//! produces a host that hangs at startup, which is the least debuggable failure
//! this resolver can prevent.
