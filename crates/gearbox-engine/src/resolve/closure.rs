//! Step 2: the co-location closure.
//!
//! This is the step that carries the project's most consequential finding. A
//! gear's `deps` are link-time: the gear macro emits a hidden re-export per
//! entry and the registry treats a missing one as a hard `MissingDeps` failure,
//! so a process containing a gear contains everything that gear reaches. The set
//! is therefore a **closure, not a partition** -- two processes may legitimately
//! share gears, and no resolver decision can sever an edge inside one.
//!
//! Breadth-first from the selected gears, popping in sorted order, so the answer
//! is the same on every run and on every machine.
