//! Assembling a [`GearDescriptor`] from its two halves.
//!
//! Under ADR `cpt-gearbox-adr-macro-projected-catalogue` each fact has exactly
//! one author. The Rust attributes own the gear's identity, capabilities,
//! co-location dependencies, lifecycle and client trait, plus the identity,
//! version and kind of every contract. The description owns presentation, the
//! crate reference, transports, projections, endpoints, cluster requirements
//! and criticality. This module is the only place the two meet, which is why
//! the split is legible here rather than smeared across the codebase.
//!
//! Nothing in here *compares* the halves, because there is nothing to compare:
//! that was the old cross-check design, and its diagnostics (GBX0201-0205) are
//! retired.
