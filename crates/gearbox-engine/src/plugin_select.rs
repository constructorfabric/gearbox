//! Resolving which plugin implementation a host gets, per deployment profile.
//!
//! This is the half that needs both halves: the catalogue says which extension
//! points exist and what each plugin implements, the product says which
//! implementations are linked and how they are configured. Neither alone can
//! answer "will this host find a plugin".
//!
//! Two levels, and they must not be conflated:
//!
//! - **Composition-time**, decided here: which implementations are linked into
//!   the process. A plugin absent from the binary registers no GTS instance and
//!   does not exist for the host.
//! - **Runtime**, decided by the host: which linked implementation wins for a
//!   given call. `TOOLKIT_PLUGINS.md` allows selection "by configuration,
//!   tenant, or other context", so several implementations of one point may be
//!   linked deliberately.
//!
//! So a second matching implementation is reported as information, not as an
//! error: it is defined behaviour, and it may be exactly what a multi-tenant
//! product wants.
