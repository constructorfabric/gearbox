//! `gearbox validate`: everything checkable without resolving.
//!
//! Deliberately not a new set of checks. Loading a catalogue already reports
//! `GBX01xx` (evaluation), GBX0206, GBX0209, GBX0210 and GBX0211, and validate's
//! job is to run that and give the operator an exit code. What it *adds* is the
//! one join that does not need the resolver: a product's selected gears against
//! the catalogue's keys.
//!
//! That join is worth doing here rather than waiting for M4 because of the
//! numbers. The tree holds 44 `#[toolkit::gear]` attributes and 14 descriptions,
//! so a selected gear that is missing from the catalogue is usually a gear
//! nobody has described yet -- not a typo. Those two want opposite responses:
//! one is "here is the `gear.gdl` to write, and here is the crate it goes
//! beside" (GBX0208), the other is "no crate anywhere declares this"
//! (GBX0301). Reporting them as one code would make the common case unhelpful.
