//! Several source roots, and what happens when two of them claim one gear.
//!
//! Multiple roots stopped being hypothetical when the Studio began deriving them
//! from a product's own `sources` list: a product that names two checkouts gets
//! two roots, and nobody had to decide anything for that to happen. The question
//! this file pins down is the one that decision created -- if both roots declare
//! the same `GearId`, which one is in the catalogue, and does anyone say so?
//!
//! See ADR `cpt-gearbox-adr-multiple-source-roots`.
