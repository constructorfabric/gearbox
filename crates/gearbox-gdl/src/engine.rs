//! Evaluating one GDL file into the facts it declares.
//!
//! Note what this does *not* produce: a [`gearbox_ir::GearDescriptor`]. Under
//! ADR `cpt-gearbox-adr-macro-projected-catalogue` a description does not carry
//! the gear's id, capabilities, co-location dependencies, lifecycle or client
//! trait -- those are projected from the Rust attributes that own them. So a
//! `gear.gdl` alone cannot name the gear it describes, and assembling a
//! descriptor is `gearbox-engine`'s job, where both halves are in scope.
//!
//! The order here is deliberate: token scan, then parse, then evaluate.
//! Scanning first means a file full of conditionals reports every one of them
//! (GBX0103) instead of stopping at whatever the parser happens to dislike
//! first.
//!
//! Nothing in this crate reads the filesystem except the `load()` sandbox, and
//! that only within a root the caller names -- which keeps GDL testable from
//! string literals.
