///
/// Mirrored in the Studio profile form (`profileFields` in
/// `product/product-widget.tsx`), which is what stops the control offering the
/// removal in the first place. Two statements of one rule, and they must agree.
///
/// **The value beside each name is the scaffold default**, and it lives here so

/// `add_profile` refused a `self_hosted` profile with no `host`, while
/// `render_profile_entry` -- three hundred lines away, used only by the create
/// wizard -- already knew that `host = "localhost"` and
/// `worker_discovery = "static"` evaluate clean. So Add profile offered two
/// kinds that could never succeed, next to a wizard that produced both of them
/// without trouble. Every caller now reads this one table.
///
/// `static` is not a free choice: the lowering accepts exactly `static` and
/// `directory`, and `directory` makes the resolver demand `service-discovery`
/// and `grpc-hub` in the host process, which a product that was just created has
