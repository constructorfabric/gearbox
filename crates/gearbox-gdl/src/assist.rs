//! The caret's surroundings, and the vocabulary's own answer for them. Both

//! (`cpt-gearbox-adr-gdl-completion-and-hover`): a buffer mid-edit does not
//! parse. `gear(`, `gear(name = "x", ` and a half-written parameter list all
//! fail `AstModule::parse`, and those are exactly the moments completion is
//! asked for. So the six AST walks in `edit.rs` are no use here, and this reads

//! a string literal is not decidable without reading from the start, and a
//! scanner that guessed would offer the wrong call's parameters inside every
//! description that mentions a bracket in a comment. One pass over a file of a
//! few hundred lines costs nothing per keystroke.
