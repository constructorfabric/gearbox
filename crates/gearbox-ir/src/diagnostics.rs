//! Diagnostics.
//!
//! Every diagnostic the engine can emit is declared here, once, as an enum
//! variant. That makes the set exhaustive and greppable, lets the compiler catch
//! a mistyped code, and gives each code a single home for its title, default
//! severity, and doc comment.
//!
//! Two rules from the PRD are enforced structurally rather than by review:
//!
//! - `cpt-gearbox-nfr-actionable-diagnostics` -- every error-severity code
//!   carries a remedy. [`Diagnostic::error`] demands one.
//! - `cpt-gearbox-nfr-evidence-cited` -- every code asserting the runtime does
//!   not support something carries a `file:line` in `gears-rust`.
//!   [`DiagnosticCode::requires_evidence`] marks those, and
//!   [`Diagnostic::validate`] rejects them without it.
