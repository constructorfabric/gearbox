//! JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio, with LSP `Content-Length` framing.
//!
//! One server backs both the Studio and the `.gdl` language client, which is why
//! the lifecycle is LSP-shaped (`initialize` / `shutdown` / `exit`) even though
//! most methods are Gearbox's own.
//!
//! **Nothing but JSON-RPC goes to stdout.** Every diagnostic, log line and panic
//! message goes to stderr or a `gearbox/log` notification. The CLI has been
//! written to that rule from the start; this crate is the reason it exists.
//!
//! Threads live here, not in the engine. `load_catalogue_staged` is synchronous
//! with a callback, and the callback writes notifications as events arrive, so
//! the engine keeps no dependency on parallelism (ADR
//! `cpt-gearbox-adr-staged-catalogue-loading`).
