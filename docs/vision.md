# Gearbox
## Vision for a Gears Product Composition, Resolution, and Deployment System

**Status:** Vision / pitch document  
**Name:** **Gearbox**  
**Scope:** Product vision and architectural direction, not a detailed implementation design  
**Date:** 2026-08-26

# 1. Executive Summary

Gears already provides a modular Rust platform with gears, contracts, local and out-of-process execution, discovery, runtime wiring, deployment profiles, and cluster primitives.

What is still missing is a first-class way to define a **product**.

Today, product composition is distributed across Cargo features, handwritten registration code, deployment manifests, Helm charts, runtime configuration, and developer knowledge about which gears can or cannot be separated.

**Gearbox** is the proposed product composition layer for Gears.

Its purpose is to let a developer or integrator express:

- which gears belong to a product;
- which deployment profile is desired;
- which gears or roles should be replicated or sharded;
- which infrastructure already exists;
- which capabilities are required;
- which provider choices are explicit and which are automatic;
- which policies/preferences should guide automatic choices.

Gearbox then deterministically derives a valid concrete product:

- the application/pod topology;
- local vs remote contract bindings;
- contract compatibility;
- required transports and discovery;
- cluster primitive providers;
- per-instance addressing requirements;
- build graph;
- generated application crates;
- container images;
- Helm deployment artifacts;
- documentation and other derived outputs.

The central product principle is:

> **Configure intent. Derive implementation.**

The central architecture principle is:

> **Rust attributes stay authoritative for every fact they already carry.  
> `gear.gdl` declares the product metadata they cannot express, and restates nothing.  
> Starlark is the authoring runtime.  
> Rust IR is the model.  
> The Rust resolver is the authority.  
> `product.lock` is the resolved product snapshot.  
> GUI, TUI, CLI, and MCP are clients of the same engine.**

Gearbox is designed to be **AI-native, but not AI-dependent**.

External AI agents can control it through MCP and skills, but no LLM is involved in correctness or resolution.

---

# 2. Why This Exists

Gears is evolving from a framework into a platform from which multiple products and deployments can be assembled.

That creates a product-line problem.

A product is no longer simply:

```text
cargo build --features foo,bar,baz
```

A real product has relationships and constraints:

```text
Gear A consumes Contract X
Gear B provides Contract X

Gear C requires:
    Linearizable Cache
    Prefix Watch

Deployment = Kubernetes

Role ingest:
    sharded
    replicas = 3
    requires stable instance addressing

Public API:
    exposed through an edge provider
```

The correct concrete implementation depends on all of these facts together.

Examples:

- a contract may be local in Embedded and remote in Kubernetes;
- a local-only extension contract cannot cross a process boundary;
- an Event Broker shard may require per-instance addressability;
- a leader-election requirement can potentially be satisfied by a Kubernetes Lease while cache is provided by Redis or PostgreSQL;
- a remote critical dependency must affect readiness but must not become a global startup dependency;
- an explicit provider override must still satisfy the required capabilities.

Today, humans make many of these decisions manually.

That does not scale.

---

# 3. Product Vision

Gearbox should make the following scenario routine:

```text
1. Choose existing Gears components.
2. Add a custom Gear.
3. Describe the product.
4. Select a deployment profile:
       embedded
       self-hosted
       kubernetes
5. Resolve the product.
6. Inspect why every important decision was made.
7. Generate build and deployment artifacts.
8. Change deployment profile without changing Gear source code.
```

This is the canonical acceptance scenario.

The same Gear source should be usable across all supported deployment profiles wherever its declared semantics permit it.

That is a core promise of the system:

> **Deployment topology should change composition and binding, not business code.**

---

# 4. Why “Gearbox”

The name is **Gearbox**.

It communicates the intended abstraction well:

- Gears are reusable mechanisms/components.
- A gearbox is what they become once they are assembled: the assembly is already in the word.
- The result is more than a list of parts: relationships, compatibility, constraints, and topology matter.

The name is preferable for a pitch to a generic “Gears Configurator”, which sounds like a settings editor rather than a product-composition system.

An earlier working name, “Gearbox Builder”, spelled the assembly out in a suffix. That was
redundant. A gearbox is not a pile of gears; it is gears meshed into one mechanism, so “Builder”
only restated what the root already carried.

The internal CLI/tool names can still use existing naming conventions such as:

```text
cargo gears ...
```

The product name and executable names do not need to be identical.

---

# 5. What Gearbox Is

Gearbox is a **software product-line configurator and resolver** for Gears.

Conceptually, it is closer to:

- eCos CDL;
- Kconfig;
- Bazel-style declarative composition;
- a package/dependency resolver;
- a deployment planner;

than to a normal configuration editor.

It operates over:

```text
Components
Contracts
Requirements
Capabilities
Providers
Deployment topology
Roles
Shards
Preferences
Policies
```

and produces a valid resolved product.

---

# 6. What Gearbox Is Not

Gearbox is not:

- a replacement for Cargo;
- a replacement for Kubernetes;
- a replacement for Helm;
- a general-purpose programming language;
- a runtime service mesh;
- an AI agent;
- a chat UI;
- an OPA/Rego policy engine;
- a generic infrastructure-as-code system;
- a second implementation of Gears runtime semantics.

It sits above existing mechanisms and composes them.

# 8. One Source of Truth for Gear Product Metadata

A major decision is to avoid spreading product metadata across:

```text
Cargo.toml metadata
YAML
Starlark
Helm values
```

That creates inevitable drift.

Rust attribute macros are deliberately **not** in that list. `#[toolkit::gear]` is not a metadata
format competing with the others: it is the mechanism that emits the gear's registration, its
link-time dependency re-exports, and its compile-time capability assertions. It stays authoritative
for every fact it already expresses, and Gearbox *reads* those facts rather than restating
them. See ADR `cpt-gearbox-adr-macro-projected-catalogue`.

Instead:

> **Every Gear has one authoritative `gear.gdl`, and it does not restate what the attributes
> already declare.**

`gear.gdl` describes the Gear-level metadata that has no home in Rust.

Example:

```python
gear(
    # The stable id, runtime capabilities, co-location deps and lifecycle are
    # read from #[toolkit::gear]. Restating any of them here is an error, and
    # `gear()` accepts each of those names only in order to refuse it by name --
    # so the diagnostic can say which attribute owns the fact.

    # Required, no default: experimental | preview | stable | deprecated, or
    # "design" for a gear with no code yet.
    maturity = "preview",

    name = "Contracts & Agreements",

    description = """
        System of Record for signed commercial terms,
        negotiated prices, and commitments.
    """,

    category = "bss",
    visibility = "internal",

    package = cargo(
        crate_name = "cf-contracts-agreements",
        lib = "contracts_agreements",
        path = ".",
    ),

    # A locator, not a restatement: nothing in a gear's own crate says where its
    # SDK lives, and the SDK is what declares the plugin-API traits this gear
    # expects or fills. Whether it *has* an extension point is then read from
    # those traits -- never declared, because `has_extension_point` in the old
    # `gear.toml` is one of the three facts that were quietly wrong (see ADR
    # `cpt-gearbox-adr-staged-catalogue-loading`, Decision Drivers).
    sdk = cargo(
        crate_name = "cf-contracts-agreements-sdk",
        lib = "contracts_agreements_sdk",
        path = "../contracts-agreements-sdk",
    ),
)
```

There is no `gear.toml` to migrate away from. When this was written, `find . -name gear.toml` over
`gears-rust` returned nothing. The platform later added 41 of them for catalogue discovery, read by
no code; they carried a name, a description, a category and three role flags, and were folded into
`gear.gdl` (ADR-0002, Amendment 2026-10-02): the three descriptive fields moved as they were, the
flags follow from what a description declares, and a gear with only documents is described at
`maturity = "design"`.

---

# 9. Stable Identity vs Display Metadata

A Gear should have a stable machine identity distinct from its display name.

The stable identity already exists in Rust and is projected from there:

```rust
#[toolkit::gear(name = "contracts-agreements", ...)]
```

The display name is what `gear.gdl` adds:

```python
gear(
    name = "Contracts & Agreements",
    maturity = "preview",
)
```

not:

```text
id = "Contracts & Agreements"
```

Note the deliberate collision of vocabulary: the macro's `name` is the stable machine identity,
while GDL's `name` is display text. GDL therefore never spells `id` at all — see §8.

The stable ID is used by:

- dependencies;
- contracts;
- product composition;
- lock files;
- MCP;
- generated artifacts;
- references across repositories.

Display text may change without breaking references.

# 10. GDL: Gears Description Language

> This section is the argument for the language. The language as it is actually
> evaluated is `docs/gdl.md`, which is normative where the two differ.

The proposed authoring language is called **GDL — Gears Description Language**.

GDL is **not a new parser or programming language**.

It is:

> **a strongly constrained Gears domain API hosted in Starlark.**

File examples:

```text
gear.gdl
product.gdl
providers.gdl
presets.gdl
```

Syntax/runtime:

```text
Starlark
```

Domain model:

```text
Gears
```

This is similar in spirit to Bazel BUILD files: the underlying language is Starlark, while users interact with a domain-specific API.

---

# 11. Why Starlark

Starlark is preferred over inventing a custom language.

It already provides:

- deterministic execution;
- hermetic behavior;
- familiar Python-like syntax;
- functions;
- modules;
- comprehensions;
- reusable helpers/macros;
- mature parser/runtime tooling;
- source locations and diagnostics;
- a strong Rust implementation ecosystem.

Most importantly, it avoids turning the Gears team into accidental language-tooling maintainers.

---

# 12. GDL Must Remain Declarative

Starlark is the syntax and composition mechanism, but **resolution semantics must not move into Starlark scripts**.

Good:

```python
gear(
    name = "Event Broker",
    maturity = "preview",
    package = cargo(crate_name = "cf-event-broker", lib = "event_broker"),

    requires = [
        cluster.cache(
            # The scope name, which is the operator side of a join key a gear
            # declares in Rust as `impl ClusterProfile { const NAME }`.
            profile = "event-broker",
            capabilities = [
                cluster_cap.linearizable,
                cluster_cap.prefix_watch,
            ],
        ),
    ],
)
```

Bad:

```python
if deployment == "kubernetes":
    if redis_available:
        choose_redis()
    else:
        choose_postgres()
```

The first describes facts and intent.

The second implements the resolver in configuration scripts.

That would destroy determinism, consistency, and explainability.

---

# 13. Rust IR Is the Canonical Model

GDL evaluates into typed Rust objects.

After evaluation, the rest of Gearbox works entirely with Rust types.

Conceptually:

```rust
struct Catalogue {
    gears: Vec<GearDescriptor>,
    contracts: Vec<ContractDescriptor>,
    providers: Vec<ProviderDescriptor>,
}

struct ProductIntent {
    deployment: DeploymentProfile,
    gears: Vec<GearSelection>,
    placements: Vec<PlacementIntent>,
    overrides: Vec<ProviderOverride>,
    preferences: Vec<Preference>,
}

struct ResolvedProduct {
    gears: Vec<ResolvedGear>,
    applications: Vec<ResolvedApplication>,
    bindings: Vec<ResolvedBinding>,
    providers: Vec<ResolvedProvider>,
    requirements: Vec<ResolvedRequirement>,
    diagnostics: Vec<Diagnostic>,
    explanations: ExplanationGraph,
}
```

Exact types and naming belong in the detailed design.

The important boundary is:

```text
GDL -> typed Rust IR
```

After that, Starlark should not leak into the rest of the architecture.

---

# 14. Three Core Representations

The system must keep three concepts separate.

## 14.1 Catalogue

Developer-owned facts:

```text
what exists
what it provides
what it consumes
what it requires
what topologies it supports
what roles it has
what capabilities providers expose
```

## 14.2 Intent

User/operator choices:

```text
what is enabled
deployment profile
replicas
desired placement
provider overrides
preferences
source/version selections
```

## 14.3 ResolvedProduct

Derived implementation:

```text
actual application topology
actual local/remote bindings
actual providers
transport choice
addressability requirements
deployment requirements
generated artifact inputs
```

This split is fundamental.

---

# 15. What a Gear Descriptor Carries

> **This section predates ADR `cpt-gearbox-adr-macro-projected-catalogue`, and its original title
> claimed the opposite of what §8 decides.** It said `gear.gdl` *owns* gear composition metadata; §8

> moved. Same treatment as §18/§18.1.

A Gear descriptor was expected to include:

```text
identity
name
description
category

kind
plugin/extensibility model

Cargo package mapping

provided contracts
consumed contracts

hard dependencies

roles
shard semantics

capability requirements

deployment constraints

product visibility

configuration schema references
```

Illustrative example, and **not valid GDL today** -- `id`, `kind`, `contract(...)` and
`cargo(crate = ...)` are all refused or absent now; see §15.1:

```python
gear(
    id = "event-broker",

    name = "Event Broker",
    description = "Distributed event delivery service.",
    category = "platform",

    kind = service(),

    package = cargo(
        crate = "event-broker",
    ),

    provides = [
        contract(
            "EventBrokerApiV1",
            rust = "event_broker_sdk::EventBrokerApiV1",
        ),
    ],

    consumes = [
        contract(
            "TenantResolverApiV1",
            rust = "tenant_resolver_sdk::TenantResolverApiV1",
            from_ = "tenant-resolver",
            critical = True,
        ),
    ],

    roles = [
        role(
            "dispatcher",
            directory_name = "event-broker",
        ),

        role(
            "ingest",
            directory_name = "event-broker-ingest",
            sharded = True,
            instance_addressable = True,
        ),

        role(
            "delivery",
            directory_name = "event-broker-delivery",
        ),
    ],

    requires = [
        cluster.cache(
            capabilities = [
                "linearizable",
                "prefix-watch",
            ],
        ),

        cluster.leader_election(
            capabilities = [
                "linearizable",
            ],
        ),
    ],
)
```

The exact GDL syntax is intentionally illustrative.

## 15.1 As implemented

Six of the fields above are gone, and each went the same way: the fact was already in Rust, so the
descriptor reads it instead of restating it.

| Expected here | Where it lives now |
|---|---|
| `identity` | `#[toolkit::gear(name = ...)]`. `gear(id = ...)` is accepted only to be refused, naming the attribute that owns it. |
| `hard dependencies` | `#[toolkit::gear(deps = [...])]` -- the attribute that *emits the re-exports*, so a description evaluated before `rustc` could not replace it (§17). |
| `capability requirements` | `#[toolkit::gear(capabilities = [...])]`, which drives compile-time assertions. |
| `kind` / `plugin/extensibility model` | Declared by GTS plugin spec (`extension_point(...)`, `implements`) and checked against the SDK. First read from `pub trait *Plugin*` declarations, which the corpus falsified five ways (ADR-0002, Amendment 2026-09-24); `has_extension_point` as an unchecked boolean was one of three facts found to be quietly wrong. |
| contract `identity` and `version` | `#[toolkit::contract(gear = ..., version = ...)]` on the trait. `provide`/`consume` name the trait as a *join key* and add only what the attribute does not carry. |
| available transports | Projected from which `<Base>Rest` / `<Base>Grpc` projection traits exist beside the base. A contract with no projection is provably local, and no description can say otherwise. |

`roles` is still accepted, and that is not the same as supported -- see §33.1.

What remains is genuinely new information with no home in Rust: `name`, `description`, `category`,
`visibility`, the Cargo `package` and `sdk` locators, `docs`, `serves`, cluster `requires`,
`cluster_plugins`, and `config_schema`. A real one, in full, is
`gears/system/types-registry/types-registry/gear.gdl`:

```python
gear(
    name = "Types Registry",
    description = "Shared entity-type registry. Pulled in by roughly 22 gears via deps, so it is linked into most applications.",
    category = "core-functionality",
    visibility = "internal",

    package = cargo(
        crate_name = "cf-gears-types-registry",
        lib = "types_registry",
        path = ".",
    ),
)
```

Note what is absent and would have been required by the list above: no id, no deps, no capabilities
-- and yet the catalogue reports all three for this gear, because it read them.


---

# 16. Rust Still Defines Contract Contents

Adding `gear.gdl` for product metadata does **not** mean redefining Rust interfaces in GDL.

Rust remains the source of truth for the contract itself:

```rust
pub trait ContractsApiV1 {
    async fn get_contract(...);
    async fn sign_contract(...);
}
```

GDL declares the relationship:

```text
contracts-agreements provides ContractsApiV1
```

These are different facts.

Therefore:

```text
Rust:
    defines and implements the contract

GDL:
    declares product-level use of that contract
```

The GDL compiler/tooling should validate that referenced Rust contracts exist and are compatible with the declaration.

---

# 17. Composition Annotations Are Read, Not Duplicated

If the same information were represented in both:

```rust
#[toolkit::consumes(...)]
```

and:

```python
consumes = [...]
```

then drift would be inevitable. The resolution is not to move the fact to GDL, but to keep it where
it already is and read it:

```text
#[toolkit::consumes(...)]
   |
   +--> projected into the product catalogue
   +--> already emits the resolving client

gear.gdl
   |
   +--> the product-level facts the annotation does not carry
        (transport choice, criticality, cluster requirements)
```

The annotation is not a duplicate of a GDL field; it is the thing that makes the remote path exist
at all. `#[toolkit::consumes]` emits the resolving client, and `#[toolkit::gear(deps = ...)]` emits
the re-exports that keep a co-located dependency linked. Neither can be replaced by a description
file evaluated before `rustc` runs.

A useful consequence: the edit that makes a contract edge severable is the same edit that makes it
work. Adding `#[toolkit::consumes]` to a gear both declares the edge to the resolver and generates
the client it will need once the edge is cut.

**No Rust is generated into a gear crate.** Generated glue exists only in the composition crates
Gearbox owns end to end — a generated application crate's `main.rs` and `registered_gears.rs`.
See ADR `cpt-gearbox-adr-macro-projected-catalogue`.

---

# 18. Product Composition in `product.gdl`

Existing Gear definitions describe what components are.

`product.gdl` describes what the user wants.

Example:

```python
product(
    id = "cyber-protect",

    deployment = kubernetes(),

    gears = [
        use("event-broker"),
        use("contracts-agreements"),
        use("tenant-resolver"),
    ],

    preferences = [
        prefer_existing_infrastructure(),
    ],
)
```

This is intentionally much smaller than repeating Gear definitions.

## 18.1 As implemented

The sketch above predates the implemented surface. What `products/payments-demo/product.gdl`
actually says, and why it differs:

```python
product(
    id = "payments-demo", name = "Payments Demo", version = "0.1.0",
    sources = [source(id = "gears-rust", at = path("../../../gears-rust"))],
    profiles = [                                   # every profile, as DATA
        embedded(id = "dev"),
        self_hosted(id = "local", host = "gateway", worker_discovery = "directory"),
        kubernetes(id = "prod", discovery = "static", namespace = "payments"),
    ],
    default_profile = "dev",
    gears = [use_gear("api-gateway", source = "gears-rust")],
    bindings = [bind(consumer = "…", contract = "…/PaymentApi@v1",
                     mode = binding_mode.remote, profiles = ["local", "prod"])],
    preferences = [prefer.existing_infrastructure()],
)
```

- **`deployment = kubernetes()` became `profiles = [...]` plus `default_profile`.** One product needs
  to describe dev, on-premise and Kubernetes at once; a single `deployment` field would force one
  file per topology, and then the three would drift. Profile-scoping is a `profiles = [...]` list
  field on `bind`, `cluster_profile` and `application` — **not** an `if`, because GDL has none and a
  description that could branch on the resolve target would be a program whose output depends on how
  it was invoked.
- **`use(...)` became `use_gear(...)`,** because `use` is a Starlark-adjacent word that reads as an
  import.
- **Sources are declared once with an id and referenced by it,** rather than inlined per gear. Four
  gears from one checkout would otherwise repeat the path four times, and a lock has to record each
  source once anyway.
- **`prefer_existing_infrastructure()` became `prefer.existing_infrastructure()`,** a namespace, so
  the preference set is discoverable by completion rather than by memory.

---

# 19. Source Resolution: Path, Git, Registry

A product must be able to obtain Gears from different locations.

This should be independent of GDL semantics.

Source model:

```text
path        implemented
git         implemented (tag, rev or branch; a branch must pin something)
registry    implemented (cargo fetches; `prefix` names the package)
```

**`registry` is implemented by letting cargo do it.** No registry client of our own: a published gear
crate carries `src/` with its `#[toolkit::gear]` attribute and its `gear.gdl` beside `Cargo.toml`, and
cargo unpacks it into a directory that is, in shape, exactly what a source root wants — so the whole
catalogue, projection included, works on a registry gear without special handling. A synthesised
manifest plus `cargo metadata` buys the download, the unpack, authentication, offline mode, version
resolution and any corporate mirror the machine is configured with. The closure arrives with it,
because a gear's co-location dependencies are real Cargo dependencies. `prefix` turns a gear id into a
package name (`api-gateway` → `cf-gears-api-gateway`), and `use_gear(package = ...)` is the exit for a
gear that does not follow the house naming; a wrong guess is not silent either, since the fetched
crate's own `gear.gdl` declares its `crate_name` and GBX0209 checks it against the real
`Cargo.toml`.

A `git` source pinned to a **branch** is accepted and recorded as not immutable
(`SourceDecl::is_immutable()`), because a lock built from a branch is repeatable but not
reproducible. A `git` source that pins nothing at all is refused.

Example, and the shape changed: a source is **declared once and referenced by id**, so
`use_gear("my-gear", source = "gears-rust")` names an entry in `sources = [source(id = ..., at =
path(...))]` rather than carrying a locator inline. Two gears from the same checkout then cannot
disagree about which revision it is -- which is the whole point of pinning -- and it is why
`ProductIntent` has a `sources` map at all.

```python
product(
    gears = [
        use(
            "my-gear",
            source = path("../my-gear"),
        ),

        use(
            "mini-chat",
            source = git(
                "ssh://git/.../gears-rust",
                tag = "v0.6.1",
            ),
        ),
    ],
)
```

Later:

```python
source = registry(
    package = "cf-gears-mini-chat",
    version = "^0.7",
)
```

All source types eventually produce a local source tree containing:

```text
gear.gdl
Cargo.toml
src/
...
```

---

# 20. Why Git Support Matters Early

A private registry should not be a prerequisite for the configurator.

Git already provides:

- source retrieval;
- private repository access;
- tag/revision pinning;
- reproducible source snapshots.

The resolved lock file should pin the exact revision:

```text
source = git
rev = 8ac3e7...
```

A future registry can add semver resolution without changing the core product model.

---

# 21. `product.lock`: The Center of the Resolved Product

One of the strongest ideas from earlier exploration is:

> **`product.lock` plays for a product the role `Cargo.lock` plays for a crate** — though Gearbox itself is more than a package manager: from one description it derives applications, configuration, images, charts and the reason for each choice.

The central resolved artifact is:

```text
product.lock
```

This is not human-authored intent.

It is written by the resolver.

It captures the exact resolved product.

---

# 22. What `product.lock` Contains

Examples:

```text
product identity
deployment profile

exact Gear source revisions/versions

enabled Gears

resolved application topology

replica counts

local/remote contract bindings

contract identities and versions

selected transports

provider selections

selected vs resolved automatic choices

derived requirements

deployment requirements

explanation/provenance references
```

Example:

```toml
[product]
name = "my-product"
deployment = "kubernetes"

[[applications]]
name = "mini-chat"
gears = ["mini-chat", "types-registry"]
replicas = 3

[[binding]]
consumer = "mini-chat"
contract = "AuthnApiV1"
provider = "authn-resolver"
mode = "remote"
transport = "rest"
critical = true

[[cluster]]
scope = "event-broker"
primitive = "leader-election"
selected = "auto"
resolved = "k8s-lease"
```

The exact serialization format is a detailed-design question.

The conceptual role is not.

Two corrections to the list, both from things the resolver settled later. **Roles and shards are not
in the lock** -- one application per anchor gear, so declaring several earns `GBX0318` instead (§33.1);
the entry has been removed rather than left to be discovered. And `selected vs resolved` is narrower
than it reads: it is `Selected<T>` sitting next to the resolved value on the same record, carrying
the request and the `downgraded_by` code when the two differ -- not a parallel copy of the product.

---

# 23. Why `product.lock` Is Important

Every downstream generator should consume the same resolved product.

```text
product.gdl
     |
     v
 resolver
     |
     v
 product.lock
     |
     +--> Cargo
     +--> binaries
     +--> Dockerfiles
     +--> Helm
     +--> docs
     +--> SBOM
     +--> architecture diagrams
```

This avoids separate implementations of resolution in every renderer.

It also makes product changes diffable.

---

# 24. Deployment Profiles

Gears intentionally defines three main deployment topologies:

```text
embedded
self-hosted
kubernetes
```

Gearbox should model these as explicit finite choices.

Use the term:

```text
DeploymentProfile
```

Do not overload the word “profile” for unrelated concepts.

---

# 25. Product Presets Are Different

Examples:

```text
dev
minimal
production
```

These are **presets**, not deployment profiles.

A preset is an intent overlay or preference bundle.

> **Not implemented.** There is no `preset(...)` in GDL, and no `require_high_availability()` or
> `prefer_external_state()`. The only preference surface that exists is `preferences = [...]` on
> `product(...)`, taking `prefer.existing_infrastructure()`, `prefer.fewer_applications()` and
> `prefer.isolate()`. The distinction this section draws -- a preset is not a deployment profile --
> is still the right one, and is why profiles were not allowed to absorb it.

For example:

```python
preset(
    "production",

    preferences = [
        require_high_availability(),
        prefer_external_state(),
    ],
)
```

A production preset could potentially be used with multiple deployment profiles.

---

# 26. Cluster Profile Is Also Different

The cluster subsystem uses `ClusterProfile` to identify a logical scope such as:

```text
event-broker
```

This is neither:

- a DeploymentProfile;
- nor a product preset.

In Gearbox’s IR/UI, a clearer semantic name may be:

```text
ClusterScope
```

even if the runtime API keeps the existing name.

## 26.1 It is a projected join key, not free text

Per ADR `cpt-gearbox-adr-macro-projected-catalogue`, the profile name is **projected** from the
consumer's own Rust:

```rust
struct EventBrokerProfile;                        // private
impl ClusterProfile for EventBrokerProfile {
    const NAME: &'static str = "event-broker";    // read literally
}
```

Three properties of that shape drive the implementation, and all three are taken from the platform's
only production instance rather than assumed:

- **The name is read from `const NAME`, never derived from the marker's identifier.** Kebab-casing
  `EventBrokerProfile` would give `event-broker-profile`, which is wrong.
- **Visibility is irrelevant.** The marker is private, and it lives in a domain module rather than
  beside the gear struct, so the whole crate `src/` is scanned.
- **A `gear.gdl` requirement must name a profile the crate implements**, and `profile` has no
  default. The SDK maps the name to `ClientScope::new("cluster:{name}")` and resolves whatever
  backend is registered there, so a name nothing supplies is not a typo that degrades — it is a scope
  nothing registered, failing at startup with `ProfileNotBound`. Mismatch is `GBX0508`.

## 26.2 Requiring a cluster primitive pins the consumer's process

Worth stating because nothing in `cluster.cache(...)` hints at it. The cluster gear registers its
backends in the **process-local** `ClientHub` and exposes no remote surface — no `provides`, no
rest/grpc contract, no binary target — and a consumer resolves them by a synchronous scoped lookup
with no remote path and no fallback. A consumer must therefore be in the same process, which is
exactly what `deps = [cluster]` expresses, and that edge is never severable by the resolver.

`gears/system/cluster/docs/DESIGN-DEPLOYABLE-GEAR.md` proposes a separately deployable cluster gear,
which would make the edge severable and move capability matching to runtime. It is explicitly
`Status: Proposed — design only, no implementation`, it describes cluster as scaling by
interchangeable replicas rather than as a singleton, and it leaves the "one cluster process per
deployment" question undecided. Gearbox therefore models today's constraint and emits `GBX0607` as a
hint pointing at that document, rather than anticipating a topology the runtime cannot yet serve.

**The passage above has been overtaken, and is kept because the correction is instructive.** The
deployable cluster gear is built: `gears-rust` commit `de3551f9` introduced `RemoteClusterClient`
over gRPC, one `dyn ClusterClient` per process with local winning over remote, and an endpoint
derived by DNS rather than configured. Gearbox already sees it — the cluster gear projects
`runtime_caps = [rest, stateful, system, grpc]`, and the Helm generator emits a dedicated `cluster`
Service on port 50051 for whichever application holds the gear
(`crates/gearbox-engine/src/generate/helm.rs`, `templates/helm/service.yaml.jinja`).

So a cluster consumer is **not** pinned to the gear's process, and two things followed from believing
otherwise. A diagnostic was added to report the "split" as a defect and then withdrawn, because the
constraint it reported does not exist. And more consequentially, the configuration generator keyed a
scope's backend section on the requester being co-located, which meant the demo's `prod` profile —
where an application pin separates them — configured the cluster gear with nothing at all while the lock
said the scope had resolved. That filter is gone: the section is written wherever the gear is, and
the gear serves it to consumers in either direction.

What remains true of `GBX0607` is narrower than it reads: `deps = [cluster]` really is a hard
topo-sort edge, and a gear that declares it cannot be spawned out of process
(`RegistryError::UnknownDependency`). That is a fact about `deps`, not about cluster's reachability,
and the code's own evidence citation still asserts the latter.

---

# 27. Deployment Changes Binding, Not Business Code

The same contract relationship can resolve differently by topology.

Example:

```text
Orders consumes BillingApi
Billing provides BillingApi
```

## Embedded

```text
Orders + Billing
same process

binding:
    local
transport:
    none
discovery:
    none
```

## Kubernetes

```text
Orders pod
Billing pod

binding:
    remote
transport:
    REST or gRPC
discovery:
    required
readiness:
    eventual
```

The user should not manually specify `local = true/false`.

It is derived from placement.

---

# 28. Contract Graph Is First-Class

The product cannot be modeled only as:

```text
Gear -> Gear
```

because one Gear can expose multiple contracts.

The model must include:

```text
Consumer -> Contract -> Provider
```

Example:

```text
Orders
   |
   | consumes
   v
BillingApiV2
   ^
   | provides
   |
Billing
```

This enables static compatibility validation.

---

# 29. Contract Versions

If:

```text
orders consumes BillingApiV2
```

but:

```text
billing provides BillingApiV1 only
```

then the resolver can fail before deployment:

```text
ERROR:
BillingApiV2 is required by orders,
but billing only provides BillingApiV1.
```

This is valuable even if runtime discovery does not yet fully encode contract identity.

---

# 30. Hard Dependencies vs Contract Consumption

These are different relationships.

## Hard dependency

Meaning:

```text
must be co-located
affects process startup/lifecycle
```

## Contract consumption

Meaning:

```text
consumer needs a contract
provider may be local or remote
remote binding may become ready later
```

Never collapse both into:

```text
depends_on
```

That would destroy important deployment semantics.

---

# 31. Contract Kind Creates Placement Constraints

Existing contract categories such as:

```text
Api
Embedded
Backend
Extension
```

imply topology constraints.

For example, a local-only extension contract cannot cross process boundaries.

Gearbox should detect this statically.

Example diagnostic:

```text
FooExtension is local-only.

consumer:
    plugin-manager

provider:
    foo-extension

placement:
    different applications

Possible fixes:
    colocate components
    select a remote-capable contract
    change deployment topology
```

---

# 32. Eventual Readiness Is Runtime Semantics

Remote dependencies should not be turned into a global startup graph.

For multi-process deployments:

```text
processes start independently
remote dependencies resolve asynchronously
critical dependencies gate readiness
```

Gearbox may derive:

```text
binding = remote
critical = true
readiness-gating = true
```

but the runtime remains responsible for eventual readiness.

---

# 33. Roles and Shards

> **The runtime has no role concept, so this section describes an intent rather than a capability.**
> `gear()` still accepts `roles`, and the resolver answers with `GBX0318 -- a gear's roles cannot all be deployed
> by the runtime`. §33.1 says why, with the evidence.

Role and shard semantics were expected to be first-class product metadata.

Example Event Broker structure:

```text
event-broker

roles:
    dispatcher
    ingest
    delivery
```

Role-specific APIs may map to different logical directory names:

```text
dispatcher -> event-broker
ingest     -> event-broker-ingest
delivery   -> event-broker-delivery
```

Shards are a separate dimension.

Conceptually:

```text
role:
    directory name

shard:
    labels / instance selection
```

Avoid reintroducing a generic `entrypoint` flag.

## 33.1 As implemented

The mapping above -- one gear, several roles, each with its own directory name -- is the part the
runtime cannot do. A worker's directory identity *is* its anchor gear's id, taken verbatim from a
field fixed in the binary, with no configuration override
(`crates/gearbox-ir/src/resolved.rs`, on `ResolvedApplication::anchor`). One binary therefore registers
under exactly one name, and "dispatcher -> event-broker, ingest -> event-broker-ingest" would need
three.

So declaring roles is accepted, and a product that selects a gear with several is told only one is built: **`GBX0318`, a `Topology` warning** -- "roles are
not supported by the runtime". A warning rather than an error, because the description is not wrong
about what it wants; it is wrong about what exists. And a `RuntimeGap` code is one of those required
to cite the `file:line` in `gears-rust` that substantiates the claim
(`cpt-gearbox-nfr-evidence-cited`), so the refusal carries its own proof rather than an opinion.

Shards are untouched by this: they are instance selection, not directory identity, and nothing here
decides them either way yet.

---

# 34. Embedded Topology Has Structural Limits

Some role/shard layouts cannot exist in Embedded mode.

Example:

```text
deployment = embedded
event-broker.ingest.replicas = 3
event-broker.ingest.sharded = true
```

If the runtime semantics require separately addressable role/shard instances, the configuration is invalid.

Diagnostic:

```text
Event Broker ingest sharding requires
instance-addressable role-separated deployment.

Embedded cannot represent this topology.

Supported alternatives:
    self-hosted
    kubernetes
```

---

# 35. Per-Instance Addressability Is a Requirement

Do not encode:

```text
use StatefulSet
```

as the semantic requirement.

Encode:

```text
PerInstanceAddressable
```

The deployment generator can then realize it with a supported mechanism such as:

- StatefulSet + headless Service;
- a self-registering workload;
- another future mechanism.

This keeps semantics separate from renderer implementation.

---

# 36. Cluster Primitives Are a Natural Capability System

The existing cluster design already resembles the intended resolver.

Primitives include concepts such as:

```text
Cache
LeaderElection
DistributedLock
```

Consumers require capabilities:

```text
Linearizable
PrefixWatch
```

Providers expose capabilities.

Gearbox should resolve:

```text
Requirement -> Provider capabilities
```

before runtime.

---

# 37. Cluster Provider Choice Is Per Primitive

Do not define:

```text
cluster.provider = redis
```

as a global concept.

Mixed configurations are valid and useful.

Example:

```text
cache             -> Redis
leader election   -> Kubernetes Lease
distributed lock  -> Redis
```

or:

```text
cache             -> PostgreSQL
leader election   -> SDK implementation over cache
distributed lock  -> PostgreSQL advisory locks
```

depending on actual provider capabilities and availability.

---

# 38. Automatic Selection

The UI and GDL should support:

```text
Automatic
```

for provider choices.

Example, and it is not what was built -- there is no `cluster(...)` block and no `auto()`:

```python
cluster(
    cache = auto(),
    leader_election = auto(),
    lock = auto(),
)
```

**Automatic is the absence of a declaration, not a value.** The real surface is
`cluster_profile(name = ..., cache = provider("postgres"), profiles = [...])`, where
`leader_election` and `lock` are optional -- omitting one *is* asking for automatic, and the lock
records it as `Choice::Auto` beside whatever was resolved. Writing `auto()` would have made "decide
for me" a thing to type, and then "did anyone decide this" would depend on spelling rather than on
structure.

One asymmetry worth knowing: `cache` is **required**. A cluster scope with no cache has nothing to
layer the other primitives over, so there is no automatic answer to give.

The resolver chooses a valid implementation.

---

# 39. Selected vs Resolved

This distinction must be preserved.

User intent:

```text
leader-election = automatic
```

Resolved result:

```text
leader-election = Kubernetes Lease
```

Represent:

```text
selected:
    Automatic

resolved:
    K8s Lease
```

This concept can generalize beyond cluster primitives.

---

# 40. Hard Constraints vs Preferences

The resolver must distinguish:

## Hard constraints

Example:

```text
cache must support PrefixWatch
```

## Preferences

Example:

```text
prefer existing infrastructure
avoid adding external stateful systems
prefer deployment-native services
```

A hard constraint determines validity.

A preference chooses among multiple valid candidates.

---

# 41. Do Not Overbuild Scoring Too Early

Early repository analysis found only a small number of real cluster providers in the current implementation.

Therefore the first resolver may not need a sophisticated optimization engine.

V1 can begin with:

```text
valid / invalid
deterministic candidate choice
simple priority rules
```

and add richer scoring when there are actually multiple meaningful valid alternatives.

The architecture should allow preferences without requiring an elaborate solver on day one.

---

# 42. Generic Requirement / Capability Model

The cluster model suggests a system-wide abstraction.

Possible requirements:

```text
RemoteCallable
LocalOnly
PerInstanceAddressable
ServiceDiscovery
PublicIngress
PlatformIdentity

LinearizableCache
PrefixWatch
LeaderElection
DistributedLock
```

Possible providers:

```text
REST projection
    provides RemoteCallable

Kubernetes workload strategy
    provides PerInstanceAddressable

Redis provider
    provides Cache
    provides LinearizableCache
    provides PrefixWatch

Kubernetes Lease
    provides LeaderElection
```

This could keep the resolver generic instead of accumulating subsystem-specific branching.

---

# 43. Resolver Responsibilities

The deterministic Rust resolver should handle:

```text
dependency closure
contract compatibility
placement constraints
application grouping
local/remote binding derivation
transport selection
capability matching
provider selection
deployment requirements
role/shard constraints
automatic defaults
preferences
diagnostics
explanation provenance
```

---

# 44. Resolver Implementation Strategy

Do not begin with SAT/SMT unless the actual problem requires it.

A practical V1 can use:

```text
typed graph traversal
constraint propagation
candidate filtering
exact-one selection
deterministic priorities
simple preferences
```

The system should still define its own constraint IR so a more sophisticated solver could be added later.

---

# 45. Explainability Is a Product Feature

Every important automatic choice should answer:

```text
Why?
```

Example:

```text
Why was K8s Lease selected for leader election?
```

Structured answer:

```text
K8s Lease

Required because:
    Event Broker requires linearizable leader election.

Valid because:
    Kubernetes Lease satisfies LeaderElection.Linearizable.

Preferred because:
    deployment = Kubernetes
    no additional infrastructure is required.

Alternatives:
    PostgreSQL/SDK
    etcd
```

The resolver should build provenance **during resolution**, not attempt to reconstruct it later.

---

# 46. Explanation Graph

Conceptually:

```text
K8sLease
   selected because
       Requirement:
           LeaderElection.Linearizable

   preferred because
       Deployment:
           Kubernetes

       Preference:
           MinimizeAdditionalInfrastructure
```

This graph can be consumed by:

- CLI;
- GUI;
- TUI;
- MCP;
- AI agents.

---

# 47. Canonical Build Output: Generated Application Crates

One important earlier observation remains valuable:

A major obstacle to “Gear = application/pod” is not necessarily runtime support.

It is the burden of manually creating and maintaining many application crates.

Gearbox can generate them.

Example:

```text
.gears/
    mini-chat/
        Cargo.toml
        main.rs
        registered_gears.rs

    authn-resolver/
        Cargo.toml
        main.rs
        registered_gears.rs

    event-broker-ingest/
        Cargo.toml
        main.rs
        registered_gears.rs
```

Each resolved application becomes a generated build target.

---

# 48. Application Topology Is a Resolver Output

Example `product.lock` concept:

```toml
[[applications]]
name = "mini-chat"
gears = ["mini-chat", "types-registry"]
replicas = 3

[[applications]]
name = "authn-resolver"
gears = ["authn-resolver"]
replicas = 2
```

Hard/co-location dependencies determine application grouping.

Remote-capable contract edges can cross those boundaries.

---

# 49. Build Artifacts

The resolved product can generate:

```text
Cargo.toml per application
main.rs
registered_gears.rs
Dockerfile per image
Cargo feature/package selection
CI build matrix
SBOM
```

Not all outputs need to exist in MVP.

---

# 50. Deployment Artifacts

Potential generated outputs:

```text
Helm umbrella chart
subcharts/components
Deployment/StatefulSet shapes
Services
RBAC
ServiceAccounts
ConfigMaps
values.generated.yaml
values.schema.json
Docker image references
```

The generator consumes `ResolvedProduct`.

It should not make independent semantic decisions.

---

# 51. Text Templates vs Structured Serialization

A valuable implementation rule from earlier analysis:

> **Template text. Serialize data.**

Use a text template engine where text generation is natural:

```text
Dockerfile
generated main.rs
possibly Helm template source
```

Use serde/structured serialization for:

```text
product.lock
values.generated.yaml
values.schema.json
Chart.yaml
machine-readable metadata
```

Do not template YAML structures unless necessary.

---

# 52. Helm and Template Delimiters

Helm itself uses:

```text
{{ ... }}
```

A Jinja-compatible generator using the same delimiters will conflict.

If MiniJinja or similar is used for Helm template source generation, use alternative delimiters for the outer generator, for example:

```text
<< ... >>
```

so Helm expressions remain untouched.

---

# 53. Helm Generator Principles

Generated Helm should follow conventional enterprise-friendly patterns.

## 53.1 `values.schema.json`

Every generated chart should provide machine-validated values schemas.

The resolver/generator knows:

```text
field exists
field type
whether field is required
```

The operator supplies environment-specific values.

---

# 54. Existing Infrastructure Pattern

External infrastructure should be easy to reuse.

Example pattern:

```text
postgresql.enabled = false

externalDatabase.host = ...
externalDatabase.existingSecret = ...
```

This allows the same generated product to integrate into an existing cluster rather than always deploying bundled dependencies.

---

# 55. Secrets

Generated defaults should not contain application secrets.

Prefer:

```text
existingSecret
```

and integrate with the operator’s secret-management mechanism:

```text
External Secrets Operator
Sealed Secrets
SOPS
Vault
other enterprise tooling
```

---

# 56. Helm Escape Hatches

Generated charts should expose standard integration controls such as:

```text
nameOverride
fullnameOverride

global.imageRegistry
global.imagePullSecrets

podAnnotations
nodeSelector
tolerations
affinity
resources

extraEnv
extraVolumes

serviceAccount.create
serviceAccount.name

podSecurityContext
```

The exact supported surface belongs in detailed design.

---

# 57. Render Without Cluster Access

Charts should render deterministically without requiring access to the Kubernetes API.

Avoid generators that rely on live-cluster state during rendering.

This preserves:

```text
GitOps diffs
offline validation
reproducibility
CI rendering
```

---

# 58. Generated vs Operator-Owned Values

Keep generated semantic values separate from human/environment overrides.

Possible model:

```text
values.generated.yaml
    generated from product.lock

values.yaml
    operator-owned
```

Regeneration must not destroy operator values.

---

# 59. GUI and TUI

The core design supports both:

```text
Tauri GUI
ratatui TUI
```

but neither contains semantic logic.

Both are clients of the Rust engine.

---

# 60. Suggested GUI Structure

```text
Product
├── Deployment
├── Gears
├── Contracts
├── Cluster
├── Edge
├── Security
└── Artifacts
```

A graph view can show:

```text
consumer -> contract -> provider
```

and:

```text
hard co-location edges
remote-capable contract edges
```

## 60.1 As implemented

The Product view is this tree, with three departures, each for a reason worth
stating rather than leaving to be noticed.

**There is no Deployment branch.** The profile switch *is* the deployment control,
and it has to stay usable while a resolution is in flight -- a branch of the
resolved product cannot be, because there is no resolved product yet. So the
switch, the resolved profile and the link to the description live in the panel's
header.

**Security is absent** because nothing in the IR models it. Naming an empty branch
would claim a surface that does not exist.

**Artifacts are absent** because they need `capabilities.generate`, which this
engine reports as `false`. It returns when the generator does.

Applications, on the other hand, is a branch §60 does not list and the resolver
computes -- and it is the one that makes co-location legible, since a gear reached
by two closures appears in both boxes. Added.

# 61. “Why?” in the UI

A details pane could display:

```text
BillingApiV1

Consumer:
    orders

Provider:
    billing

Binding:
    REST

Why remote?
    orders and billing are in different Kubernetes pods

Discovery:
    DirectoryService / deployment-specific resolver

Readiness:
    critical dependency

Transport:
    HTTP

Contract:
    BillingApiV1
```

Explainability should not depend on an LLM.

---

# 62. TUI

A compact TUI can expose:

```text
components
enabled state
contracts
requires
provides
diagnostics
why
validate
save
```

This is useful in SSH/CI/platform-engineering environments.

---

# 63. Do Not Put an AI Chat Into GUI/TUI

Current direction:

> **Do not embed an LLM chat as a core Gearbox feature.**

Reasons:

```text
model/provider integration
API credentials
streaming
conversation state
tool loops
prompt injection surface
permissions
duplicate UX with existing developer agents
```

Developers already work inside AI-enabled editors and agents.

Gearbox should expose the engine to those agents instead.

## 63.1 Amended 2026-09-13: narrowed, not reversed

**Status: amended by ADR `cpt-gearbox-adr-native-chat-surface`. The text above
stands as the reasoning; the blanket prohibition does not.**

Seven of the eight reasons listed above object to *building chat
infrastructure* — provider integration, credentials, streaming, session state,
tool loops, and the input surface. Theia AI supplies all seven, and the
application already depends on it, so that cost is paid whether or not the
surface is finished.

The eighth — duplicate UX with existing developer agents — still holds, and is
why §64 remains the direction for agents outside the IDE. It is also the one an
in-IDE surface answers rather than worsens: an external agent cannot see what is
selected in Studio, which profile is being shown, or which resolution produced
the diagnostics on screen. That state lives in the frontend and is not on the
wire.

**What is now permitted is narrow:** a chat that is a *view over the resolver*.
Every tool it has returns engine output; it cannot read a description, a gear's
source, or the filesystem, so it has no means to form an opinion of its own
about a topology. Its previews are the engine's own dry runs and write nothing,
and its single write verb is the previewed, operator-confirmed one ADR-0010
requires.

**What is still forbidden:** a general-purpose assistant in this application.
No file tools, no terminal, no write that skips the preview, and no language
model in the engine, the CLI, or any assertion path. §70's rule governs —
`resolver decides / LLM explains` — and §61 stands unchanged: explainability
does not depend on an LLM, because the explanation is the resolver's and the
chat only reads it aloud.

---

# 64. MCP Is the Agent Interface

Gearbox should expose a first-class MCP adapter over the Rust engine.

Architecture:

```text
                    Rust config-engine
                         |
         +---------------+---------------+
         |               |               |
        CLI             TUI             GUI

                         |
                         v
                    MCP adapter
                         |
           +-------------+-------------+
           |             |             |
      Claude Code      ChatGPT       Cursor
           |             |             |
           +-------- external agents ---+
```

Agents are clients.

They are not part of the product authority.

---

# 65. MCP Wraps the Engine, Not the CLI

Avoid:

```text
MCP
  ->
shell command
  ->
CLI
  ->
engine
```

Prefer:

```text
MCP adapter
    ->
Rust engine API
```

This preserves typed semantics and structured errors.

---

# 66. Potential MCP Operations

Illustrative:

```text
product.inspect
product.resolve
product.validate
product.explain

gear.inspect
gear.enable
gear.disable

deployment.set

cluster.inspect_requirements
cluster.bind_provider

config.get
config.propose
config.diff
config.apply

artifact.preview
artifact.generate
```

The exact API follows the detailed Rust model.

---

# 67. Proposal-Based Agent Writes

AI agents should not primarily edit arbitrary YAML/TOML/GDL files directly.

Prefer a transaction/proposal model.

Example:

```text
Agent request:
    Make Event Broker HA on Kubernetes.

Proposal #42:

+ deployment = kubernetes
+ event-broker.ingest.replicas = 3
+ event-broker.ingest.sharded = true
+ cluster.leader-election = auto

Resolved:
    leader-election -> K8s Lease

Validation:
    OK
```

Then:

```text
review
diff
apply
```

The proposal above is illustrative and uses two surfaces that no longer exist: `deployment =` became
`profiles = [...]` plus `default_profile` (§18.1), and `event-broker.ingest.*` addresses a role, which
the runtime has no concept of (§33.1). The shape of the mechanism -- propose, resolve, validate,
review, apply -- is what this section is about and is unaffected.

The write side of it is now decided rather than open: ADR
`cpt-gearbox-adr-authoring-ownership-tiers` sets out what may be written and by whom, and "a preview
is not optional" is one of its consequences rather than a preference here.

---

# 68. Skills Live Outside the Engine

Skills are agent workflows.

Examples:

```text
configure-ha-kubernetes
configure-on-prem
minimize-infrastructure
harden-production
migrate-contract-v1-v2
diagnose-wiring
configure-cluster
review-product-config
generate-deployment
```

They operate through MCP tools.

They do not own configuration semantics.

---

# 69. Tool vs Skill

## Tool

Primitive typed operation:

```text
set_deployment
bind_cluster_provider
inspect_contract
validate
```

## Skill

Workflow:

```text
configure-ha-kubernetes
```

This keeps the engine stable while AI workflows evolve.

---

# 70. LLM Responsibility

AI is valuable for two jobs.

## 70.1 Human intent -> formal intent

User:

```text
Give me a cheap single-node development setup
with no external infrastructure.
```

LLM derives:

```text
deployment = embedded
availability = development
preference = minimize external infrastructure
```

The resolver determines the concrete product.

## 70.2 Explanation

The resolver returns structured provenance.

The LLM can rewrite it conversationally.

The rule is:

```text
resolver decides
LLM explains
```

not:

```text
LLM decides
LLM justifies itself
```

---

# 71. GUI as Control Plane for External AI

Even without embedded chat, the GUI can display proposals created by external agents.

Example:

```text
External proposal

Source:
    Claude Code

Deployment:
    Self-Hosted -> Kubernetes

Event Broker:
    ingest replicas 1 -> 3

Cluster:
    Leader Election
        Automatic -> K8s Lease

Status:
    valid
```

This is potentially more useful than embedding a separate chat window.

---

# 72. Rego / OPA Is a Policy Layer, Not the Product Language

Rego is useful later for organization-specific policy.

Architecture:

```text
ResolvedProduct
      |
      v
  Rego / OPA
      |
 allow / deny / warn
```

Examples:

```text
forbid standalone provider in production Kubernetes

require mTLS in regulated products

forbid public ingress without approved auth

forbid static endpoints in production
```

The distinction:

```text
resolver:
    technically valid

policy:
    organization allows or rejects it
```

---

# 73. Why Not Rego as the Main DSL

Rego excels at evaluating policy over structured data.

It is not the ideal language for:

```text
component composition
provider construction
product authoring
dependency resolution
```

Therefore Rego should remain optional and downstream of the resolver.

---

# 74. Why Not KCL/CUE as the Primary Language

KCL and CUE offer strong configuration and constraint models.

They are valid alternatives.

The current preferred direction is still Starlark because:

```text
resolution semantics remain in Rust anyway
Rust embedding is strong
build/composition precedent is mature
domain API can be tightly controlled
no separate configuration ecosystem becomes architectural authority
```

GDL remains a thin frontend over typed Rust IR.

---

# 75. Adoption Alongside Existing Metadata

Current repository metadata exists in:

```text
Rust macros
#[toolkit::gear(name, deps, capabilities, client, ctor, lifecycle)]
#[toolkit::consumes]
#[toolkit::contract]
Cargo features
handwritten registration code
```

There is no `gear.toml`: the descriptive files the platform added for a while were folded into
`gear.gdl` (ADR-0002, Amendment 2026-10-02).

Adopting Gearbox is **additive**. No attribute is migrated away from, rewritten, or
deleted. The attributes keep every fact they already carry, and `gear.gdl` is added beside the crate
carrying only the facts they do not:

```text
#[toolkit::*]  --> projected  --+
                                +--> one GearDescriptor
gear.gdl       --> declared   --+
```

What genuinely does get replaced is *handwritten registration code* — `registered_gears.rs` and the
per-application `main.rs`, which are Gearbox-owned composition artefacts, not gear source. See ADR
`cpt-gearbox-adr-macro-projected-catalogue`.

---

# 76. Parsing Rust Source Is a Permanent Catalogue Input

Earlier work explored parsing Rust source with `syn`, and an earlier draft of this document demoted
that to a one-shot migration aid. **That is inverted.** Scanning the attributes is how the catalogue
is built, on every load, not a bootstrap step:

```text
scan the gear crate's src/ tree
read #[toolkit::gear], #[toolkit::contract], #[toolkit::consumes]
project id, capabilities, co-location deps, lifecycle, contract identity
merge with the declared fields from gear.gdl
```

The consequences are accepted deliberately: catalogue assembly depends on parsing Rust
successfully, and a parse failure is a hard error rather than a warning.

What remains of migration tooling is much smaller — drafting the *declared* fields only:

```text
cargo gears migrate-gdl
   |
   +--> propose name, description, category, package(lib=...)
   +--> leave everything projectable alone
```

The generated draft is then reviewed. It never contains a projected field, because a `gear.gdl`
restating one is rejected.

## 76.1 Which means the registry must open before the parsing finishes

Parsing on every load has a cost, and it is not small. `gears/` in `gears-rust` holds **2658** Rust
files; a 14-gear slice already parses 255. So a registry or project tree that waits for projection
waits seconds, growing with the tree — and that is not a registry.

The load is therefore **staged**, and what arrives when is decided by where the fact lives:

```text
walk for gear.gdl                 -> paths                    (instant)
evaluate each description         -> name, category, docs      (milliseconds)
parse the gear crate              -> id, capabilities, deps    (the expensive part)
parse the SDK crates              -> contracts, GTS types      (shared between gears)
join                              -> plugin and contract checks
```

The awkward part is a direct consequence of §75-76: **the `id` is projected, so it does not exist
until the crate is parsed.** A tree has a name to show long before it has an identifier to key by, so
rows are keyed by the description's path and the id joins in later. An implementation that keys by id
has no choice but to block on everything.

And a partially loaded gear must not be readable as a complete one. An empty list has to keep meaning
"none", not "nobody has looked yet" — otherwise the editor states, confidently, that a gear exposes
no GTS types when the truth is that its SDK has not been opened. Unprojected gears therefore sit in a
separate pending list rather than appearing in the catalogue with holes in them.

See ADR `cpt-gearbox-adr-staged-catalogue-loading`.

---

# 77. Compatibility During Adoption

A transitional system might classify components by how much is known about them:

```text
Native GDL
Legacy inspected
Unknown legacy
```

These confidence levels are **rejected**: they would become permanent product semantics, and a
resolver that reasons over "how sure are we" is not explainable.

The end state is binary:

```text
Gear participating in Gearbox
    =>
#[toolkit::gear] present (it always is -- that is what makes it a gear)
    AND
gear.gdl present
```

A gear with attributes and no `gear.gdl` is simply not in the catalogue. That is a missing file with
an obvious fix, not a degraded confidence tier.

---

# 78. `deps` Relationships Are the Co-location Model

Repository analysis found extensive use of:

```rust
#[toolkit::gear(deps = [...])]
```

These encode co-location relationships, and they are not migration input to be translated — they
**are** the hard-dependency model, read directly. The attribute emits the hidden re-export that puts
the dependency crate physically in the binary, and the registry treats a declared dependency that is
absent as a hard failure, so these edges are never severable. Restating them in GDL would add a
second copy of a fact whose authority is the linker.

---

# 79. `consumes` / `provides` Contracts Are Read the Same Way

The repository already has contract macros and working examples. Contract identity, version,
`provides` and `consumes` are projected from them:

```text
contract identity      <-- #[toolkit::contract(gear, version)] + trait-name suffix
contract version       <-- same
provides / consumes    <-- #[toolkit::provides] / #[toolkit::consumes]
```

What GDL adds on top are the product-level choices the annotations do not carry:

```text
transport projections      <-- which transports an edge may use
local/remote runtime wiring <-- derived by the resolver from placement, never declared
criticality
```

GDL preserves the semantics established in those ADRs and runtime mechanisms because it does not
re-encode them.

---

# 80. Do Not Force Mass Migration Before Proving the Model

The system should be proven on a small, representative vertical slice first.

A good initial slice could include:

```text
mini-chat
types-registry
authn/authz/tenant resolver
a simple OoP example
cluster provider
a custom generated Gear
```

Then expand.

The objective is to validate the architecture before rewriting every Gear descriptor.

---

# 81. Canonical Acceptance Test

The most important end-to-end test is:

```text
One custom Gear
+
2-3 platform Gears
+
one product definition
+
three deployment profiles
+
zero changes to Gear business source when switching profile
```

---

# 82. Acceptance Test: Embedded

Verify:

```text
product resolves
one application where appropriate
local bindings resolve correctly
build succeeds
runtime starts
diagnostics/explanation graph are populated
```

---

# 83. Acceptance Test: Self-Hosted

Verify:

```text
multiple generated application crates
DirectoryService / endpoint resolution works
remote bindings become WireOutcome::Remote
critical remote dependencies affect readiness
same Gear business code
```

---

# 84. Acceptance Test: Kubernetes

Verify:

```text
multiple images/pods
Services generated
remote binding works
external PostgreSQL supported
existingSecret supported
no secrets embedded in values
helm template succeeds
kind deployment succeeds
same Gear business code
```

Exact runtime gaps must be checked against the current repository during detailed design.

---

# 85. Regression Against Known-Good Examples

Generated artifacts should be compared with known working repository examples.

Examples from earlier repository review included:

```text
mini-chat Helm deployment
OoP calculator example
contract examples with provides/consumes
```

The detailed design should identify the current equivalents and use them as golden references.

---

# 86. Key Assumptions Must Be Tested Early

Architecture diagrams are cheap.

The following assumptions should be validated with spikes before large implementation investment.

---

# 87. Spike A1: Real Gear in GDL

Take one real Gear.

Verify that one `gear.gdl` can represent:

```text
identity
metadata
package
contracts
hard dependencies
runtime/deployment requirements
```

without requiring a second product metadata source.

---

# 88. Spike A2: Embedded Reproduction

From:

```text
gear.gdl
product.gdl
```

generate a product that behaves equivalently to a known current Embedded deployment.

---

# 89. Spike A3: Self-Hosted

Use the same Gear source and product intent with:

```text
deployment = self-hosted
```

and prove generated application composition works.

---

# 90. Spike A4: Kubernetes Separation

Take two Gears connected by a remote-capable contract.

Place them in separate pods.

Verify:

```text
remote endpoint resolution
remote proxy registration
readiness semantics
```

---

# 91. Spike A5: Git Source

Verify end-to-end:

```text
git source
    ->
fetch
    ->
read gear.gdl
    ->
resolve
    ->
generate build
    ->
compile
```

This validates the external-integrator story before a registry exists.

---

# 92. Spike A6: Cluster Requirements

Express a real existing cluster requirement in GDL.

Verify that the resolver can validate/select an implementation without duplicating runtime logic unnecessarily.

---

# 93. Spike A7: Application Crate Generation

Generate a standalone Cargo crate for a resolved application outside the monorepo.

Prove it builds successfully from pinned sources.

---

# 94. Spike A8: Reproducible Lock

Run resolution twice against the same inputs.

Verify:

```text
identical product.lock
```

Then change one intent value and verify the lock diff is semantic and minimal.

---

# 95. Spike A9: Explanation Provenance

For every automatic choice in the spike product, verify:

```text
cargo gears explain <decision>
```

can produce a chain back to:

```text
user intent
Gear requirement
provider capability
deployment rule
```

---

# 96. Spike A10: Profile Switch Does Not Touch Gear Source

Switch:

```text
embedded
    ->
self-hosted
    ->
kubernetes
```

and verify:

```text
Gear src/ remains byte-for-byte unchanged
```

This tests the central product promise.

---

# 97. Suggested CLI Direction

The engine should be usable before GUI/TUI exist.

Potential commands:

```text
cargo gears inspect
cargo gears validate
cargo gears resolve
cargo gears explain
cargo gears build
cargo gears generate
cargo gears deploy
cargo gears migrate-gdl
```

Exact UX should follow the existing `cargo gears` tool.

---

# 98. Example: Resolve Product

```bash
cargo gears resolve product.gdl
```

Possible result:

```text
Product: cyber-protect
Deployment: kubernetes

Applications:
  event-broker-ingest x3
  event-broker-delivery x2
  authn-resolver x2

Bindings:
  EventBroker -> TenantResolverApiV1 : remote
  EventBroker -> AuthnApiV1          : remote

Cluster:
  cache             : PostgreSQL
  leader-election   : Kubernetes Lease
  lock              : PostgreSQL

Status:
  VALID
```

---

# 99. Example: Explain

```bash
cargo gears explain cluster:event-broker:leader-election
```

Output:

```text
Resolved provider:
    kubernetes-lease

Required:
    LeaderElection.Linearizable

Selected:
    automatic

Why this provider:
    deployment profile is Kubernetes
    Kubernetes Lease satisfies the requirement
    no additional infrastructure is required

Alternatives:
    ...
```

---

# 100. Example: Invalid Topology

```text
ERROR GBX-2041

event-broker.ingest requires PerInstanceAddressable.

Current deployment:
    embedded

Reason:
    ingest role is configured as sharded with 3 replicas.

Supported fixes:
    switch to self-hosted
    switch to kubernetes
    disable sharding
```

Diagnostics should be actionable and explain structural causes.

---

# 101. Workspace / Crate Decomposition

Illustrative only:

```text
toolkit/
    product-model/
    product-catalog/
    product-resolver/
    product-explain/
    product-gdl/
    product-generator/
    product-mcp/

tools/
    cargo-gears/
    gears-studio/
    gears-config-tui/
```

The repository-aware detailed design should reuse existing crate boundaries where possible.

---

# 102. Suggested Implementation Phases

## Phase 1 — Typed model

Define:

```text
Catalogue
GearDescriptor
ContractDescriptor
Requirement
Capability
Provider
ProductIntent
ResolvedProduct
Diagnostic
Explanation
```

No GUI or MCP required.

---

# 103. Phase 2 — GDL

Implement:

```text
gear.gdl
product.gdl
```

evaluation into Rust IR.

Prototype on real Gears.

---

# 104. Phase 3 — Resolver

Support:

```text
enable/disable
hard dependencies
contract graph
deployment profile
placement
local/remote derivation
basic capability/provider matching
selected vs resolved
diagnostics
explanations
```

Write `product.lock`.

---

# 105. Phase 4 — CLI and Build Generation

Generate:

```text
resolved application crates
Cargo manifests
registered gears
binaries
Dockerfiles
```

Prove Embedded and Self-Hosted first.

---

# 106. Phase 5 — Kubernetes / Helm

Generate:

```text
images
Services
workloads
umbrella chart
values schema
generated values
```

Validate with:

```text
helm template
kubeconform
kind
```

---

# 107. Phase 6 — Adoption Tooling

Add:

```text
cargo gears migrate-gdl
```

to draft the **declared** half of a `gear.gdl` for a crate that has none:

```text
propose name, description, category
propose package(crate, lib, path)
leave every projected field out -- including it would be rejected
```

It reads the attributes only to find the gear and confirm the crate resolves, not to copy facts out
of them. See §76.

---

# 108. Phase 7 — GUI/TUI

Tauri and ratatui consume the same core engine.

No UI-specific semantics.

---

# 109. Phase 8 — MCP

Expose the typed engine to external AI agents.

Use proposal/diff/apply workflows.

---

# 110. Phase 9 — Policy

Optionally add Rego/OPA for organization rules once core validity semantics are stable.

---

# 111. Explicit Non-Goals for V1

Do not require in V1:

```text
custom parser/language
SAT/SMT
complex optimization/scoring
full organizational policy engine
every current Gear migrated
private package registry
all possible cluster providers
all role/shard runtime functionality
every deployment renderer
Terraform-specific output
Ansible-specific output
Argo ApplicationSet generation
```

Build the core model first.

`embedded AI chat` was on this list until 2026-09-13. It was removed by ADR
`cpt-gearbox-adr-native-chat-surface`, which permits one narrow form of it — a
view over the resolver, with no file access and no unpreviewed write — and
leaves a general-purpose assistant out of scope. See §63.1.

---

# 112. Risks

## 112.1 GDL duplicates runtime facts

If GDL merely repeats implementation details already encoded elsewhere, drift may occur.

Mitigation:

```text
generate glue from GDL
validate referenced Rust types/contracts
remove duplicate annotations over time
```

---

# 113. Risk: Runtime Semantics Are Less Generic Than the Vision

Some desired placement/provider choices may not yet be supported by the current runtime.

Mitigation:

```text
ground every resolver rule in actual runtime capability
model unsupported states explicitly
use spikes before promising topology support
```

---

# 114. Risk: Too Much Solver Too Soon

With few providers, an elaborate optimization engine may create complexity without value.

Mitigation:

```text
start deterministic
validate constraints
add preference ranking only where multiple real choices exist
```

---

# 115. Risk: `gear.gdl` Becomes a General Programming Language

Starlark can express substantial logic.

That is useful but dangerous.

Mitigation:

```text
small domain API
typed host objects
discourage arbitrary resolver logic
keep resolution exclusively in Rust
lint unsupported patterns if necessary
```

---

# 116. Risk: Migration Becomes the Project

The current repository contains legacy metadata patterns.

Trying to convert everything before proving the system could stall the project.

Mitigation:

```text
vertical slice first
migration tool second
incremental adoption
```

---

# 117. Risk: Build and Product Versioning Are Confused

Cargo package resolution and product resolution are related but not identical.

Mitigation:

```text
Cargo owns Rust package/build semantics
Gearbox owns product composition
product.lock pins exact product resolution
```

---

# 118. Open Design Questions

Questions 1-3 are **answered**, in ADR `cpt-gearbox-adr-macro-projected-catalogue`:

1. *What exact data belongs in `gear.gdl`?* — exactly the facts no Rust attribute carries: display
   name, description, category, visibility, `package` (including the `lib` ident, which is
   undeclared in Rust), cluster requirements, transport choices, endpoints, criticality.
2. *Which current Rust macros can be generated from GDL?* — **none.** Gearbox generates Rust
   only into the composition crates it owns.
3. *Which must remain because they are compile-time language semantics?* — **all of them.**
   `#[toolkit::gear]` alone emits capability assertions, link-time dependency re-exports, the
   registrator and `inventory::submit!`, the client trait code, and `impl Runnable`.

The detailed repository-aware design should still answer:

4. How should GDL validate Rust contract references?
5. How should GDL modules/imports work?
6. Should provider definitions live beside provider crates or in shared `providers.gdl`?
7. What is the exact Product IR?
8. How is `product.lock` serialized and versioned?
9. What is the stable ID format for Gears, contracts, providers, roles, and capabilities?
10. How should package source/version resolution interact with Cargo?
11. How are optional Cargo features represented?
12. Which current deployment profiles are genuinely runnable today?
13. What gaps remain for Kubernetes endpoint resolution?
14. What current role/shard mechanisms exist versus only ADR/design?
15. Which cluster providers actually exist today?
16. Which cluster capabilities are statically discoverable?
17. How are runtime config schemas attached to the product model?
18. What is generated versus operator-owned in Helm?
19. How should application/image grouping be overridden?
20. How should proposal transactions be represented for MCP?

---

# 119. Pitch: What Changes for a Developer

Without Gearbox:

```text
clone monorepo
understand Cargo features
edit registration
understand hard dependencies
manually decide co-location
create binaries
create Dockerfiles
create Helm
wire endpoints
choose cluster providers
debug runtime mismatches
```

With Gearbox:

```text
describe Gear once
compose product
select deployment
resolve
inspect
generate
```

---

# 120. Pitch: What Changes for an Integrator

The long-term external integrator experience becomes:

```text
product.gdl

platform gears:
    fetched from git/registry

custom gears:
    local or private source

deployment:
    embedded | self-hosted | kubernetes

output:
    reproducible build
    product.lock
    images
    Helm
```

No fork of the Gears monorepo should be required.

# 121. Pitch: What Changes for Platform Engineering

The platform team gains a formal place to encode:

```text
supported deployment topologies
contract relationships
provider capabilities
product requirements
role/shard semantics
automatic choices
deployment generators
policy hooks
```

instead of leaving this knowledge scattered across:

```text
README files
Cargo features
ADR knowledge
Helm
developer memory
```

# 122. Strategic Value

Gearbox would move Gears from:

```text
a modular Rust framework
```

toward:

```text
a product construction platform
```

The difference is significant.

A framework gives developers building blocks.

A product platform knows:

```text
what the blocks are
how they fit
which combinations are valid
how they are deployed
how to explain the result
```

# 123. Why This Matters More in an AI-Driven Development World

Developers will increasingly ask agents:

```text
“Make this product HA.”
“Move this to Kubernetes.”
“Use existing PostgreSQL.”
“Separate Event Broker.”
“Why did this require Redis?”
```

Without a typed product model, an LLM can only manipulate files heuristically.

With Gearbox:

```text
natural language
    ->
MCP typed operations
    ->
deterministic resolver
    ->
validated proposal
```

This gives AI agents a safe, semantic control plane instead of a text-editing guessing game.

# 124. Strategic AI Principle

> **Do not put AI inside the source of truth.  
> Put a semantic API in front of the source of truth.**

That is why MCP is a better AI integration than an embedded chat.

# 125. Final Architecture Statement

The proposed direction can be summarized as:

> **Gearbox is the product composition and resolution layer for Gears.**
>
> **Rust attributes remain authoritative for what they already declare; `gear.gdl` adds the product
> metadata and composition semantics they cannot express.**
>
> **`product.gdl` expresses product intent.**
>
> **GDL uses Starlark as its deterministic authoring runtime.**
>
> **Typed Rust IR is the canonical internal model.**
>
> **The Rust resolver is the sole authority for dependency, contract, capability, provider, placement, and topology decisions.**
>
> **`product.lock` records the exact resolved product and becomes the input to all generators.**
>
> **CLI, TUI, GUI, and MCP are clients of the same core engine.**
>
> **AI agents interact through MCP and skills, while correctness remains deterministic.**
>
> **Rego/OPA may later enforce organization policy over resolved products, but does not replace GDL or the resolver.**

# 126. One-Slide Version

```text
GEARBOX

“Describe what the product needs. Gearbox derives the rest — and says why.”

gear.gdl              product.gdl
Gear metadata         Product intent
      \                  /
       \                /
        +--------------+
        | Rust Resolver|
        +------+-------+
               |
          product.lock
               |
     +---------+----------+
     |         |          |
   Build      Helm       Tools
                         CLI/TUI/GUI
                             |
                            MCP
                             |
                         AI Agents
```

**Configure intent. Derive a valid product. Explain every decision.**

# 127. Repository Grounding for the Next Design Phase

This vision intentionally combines:

- the current Gears deployment-profile ADR direction;
- contract binding and eventual-readiness semantics;
- current hard-dependency and contract concepts;
- role/shard and instance-addressability design;
- cluster capability/provider design;
- existing build/run/generator work;
- known-good mini-chat and OoP examples identified during earlier repository review;
- the earlier `product.lock`, generated-application, Helm, and external-integrator ideas;
- the newer decision to give product metadata one home in `gear.gdl` while leaving every Rust
  attribute authoritative for what it already declares
  (ADR `cpt-gearbox-adr-macro-projected-catalogue`);
- the newer decision to use Starlark as the GDL runtime;
- the newer decision to expose MCP rather than embed an LLM chat.

The next step is a repository-grounded DESIGN that verifies each assumption against the current `gears-rust` implementation before fixing concrete schemas, crate APIs, migration rules, and generator behavior.
