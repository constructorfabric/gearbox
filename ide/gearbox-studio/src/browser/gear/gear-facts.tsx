// **Extracted rather than copied, and the docs row is the reason.** `GearDocs`
// drags `adrLabel` with it -- the rule that a nine-ADR gear is listed as
// `ADR 001` rather than as a filename that wraps to three lines -- and a second
// copy of that rule in another file is how the two come to disagree about the
// same gear.
//
// **Only the parts two surfaces want.** The Inspector's capabilities, extension
// points, `provides` and GTS types stay in the Inspector: those are facts about
// the gear in the *catalogue*, and the settings pane is answering about one
// object in one product. What both need is the same three things -- what it is
// called, what it is for, and where to read more -- plus, for the pane, why it
// is here at all.
