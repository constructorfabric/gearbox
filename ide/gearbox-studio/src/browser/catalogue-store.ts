// replaced by a projected one, keyed by `(source, gdl_path)` because `GearId`
// is projected and does not exist at the pending stage (ADR
// cpt-gearbox-adr-staged-catalogue-loading).
//
// `load()` looks sequential and is not: notifications mutate the same `Map`
// during its awaits. Three things keep that honest. Every await resumption in
// `load()` is guarded by a load epoch, so a superseded load cannot install its
// pending set over a newer one's projections; notifications are accepted only
// while a load is *streaming*, so an abandoned load's late projections cannot
// walk an error back to `ready`; and failures move the store to an `error` state
// instead of leaving `loading` set forever.
