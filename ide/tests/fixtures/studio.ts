// The two ways this suite opens the application, and why there are two.
//
// Most conformance tests only read what the projection produced, so they can
// share one loaded application: `studio` is worker-scoped and boots once.
// The staged-loading tests cannot -- they have to watch a load happen -- so
// `freshStudio` is test-scoped and gets its own context.
//
// The split is not only about speed. Theia persists its layout, and
// `initializeLayout` runs *only* when there is no saved layout
// (`view-contributions.ts` explains why that is the right behaviour). Playwright
// gives every context an empty localStorage, so the panels open as designed --
// which means this suite depends on never setting `storageState` or otherwise
// reusing a profile. Reusing one would collapse the panels and fail half the
// claims here for a reason that has nothing to do with the claims.

   * and therefore torn down **last**, after `freshStudio` has closed its page —
   * which is the window a late write lands in.
   *
   * It deliberately does not request `studio`: the staged-loading claims use
   * `freshStudio` and are timing-sensitive, and pulling the shared session into
   * every test would boot it for them. Write stacks reach the trace file from
   * `open()`, so the file is enough.
